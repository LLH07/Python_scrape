Update (2019-09-03),"
Hey everyone. I wanted to give you an update on my videos. I will be releasing videos on threading and multiprocessing within the next week. Thanks so much for your patience. I currently have a temporary recording studio setup at my Airbnb that will allow me to record and edit the threading/multiprocessing videos. I am going to be moving into my new house in 10 days and once I have my recording studio setup then you can expect much faster video releases. I really appreciate how patient everyone has been while I go through this move, especially those of you who are contributing monthly through YouTube

Python Quick Tip: The Difference Between ¡§==¡¨ and ¡§is¡¨ (Equality vs Identity),"
In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be learning the difference between using ¡§==¡¨ and the ¡§is¡¨ keyword when doing comparisons. The difference between these is that ¡§==¡¨ checks to see if values are equal, and the ¡§is¡¨ keyword checks their identity, which means it¡¦s going to check if the values are identical in terms of being the same object in memory. We¡¦ll learn more in the video. Let¡¦s get started¡K
